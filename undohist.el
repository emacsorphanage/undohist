;;; Commentary:

;; This extension provides a way to use undo history of
;; individual file buffers persistently.
;;
;; Write the following code to your .emacs:
;;
;; (require 'undohist)
;; (undohist-initialize)
;;
;; Now you can record and recover undohist by typing
;; C-x C-s (save-buffer) an C-x C-f (find-file).
;; And then type C-/ (undo).
